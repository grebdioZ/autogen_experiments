      "MESSAGE 3 [Researcher]:\n",
      "Fraunhofer MEVIS has made significant contributions to thoracic imaging, focusing on the development of advanced software solutions for lung and cardiac image analysis. Their work encompasses several key areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lung Image Analysis**: They have developed automated tools for CT and MRI lung image analysis aimed at detecting, monitoring diseases, and assisting in intervention planning. These tools facilitate the segmentation of lungs and lung lobes, aiding in follow-up analyses and treatment planning ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/lung-image-analysis.html), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284890343_Lung_and_lung_lobe_segmentation_methods_at_Fraunhofer_MEVIS)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lung and Thoracic CT Registration**: Fraunhofer MEVIS has innovated in non-rigid lung registration techniques, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy with rapid runtimes (~25 seconds). This enables effective comparison of thoracic scans over time, which is crucial for disease progression monitoring and therapy assessment ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/fast-and-accurate-lung-image-registration.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cardiac Imaging**: Their software solutions also extend to multimodal cardiac image analysis, providing tools for cardiac structure quantification and early detection of cardiac conditions ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/solutions-for-cardiac-imaging.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Research and Contributions**: Fraunhofer MEVIS actively participates in scientific communities such as MICCAI and contributes to workshops and conferences focusing on thoracic image analysis, sharing insights and technological advancements. They also contributed to interactive visualizations like a 3D virtual journey through the heart, enhancing understanding of cardiac anatomy ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-scicom/institute-news/2020/fraunhofer-mevis-at-virtual-miccai-2020.html), [Press Release](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-scicom/press-release/virtual-journey-through-the-heart--fraunhofer-mevis-creates-a-th.html)).\n",

      "1. **Lung Image Analysis**: They have developed automated tools for CT and MRI lung image analysis aimed at detecting, monitoring diseases, and assisting in intervention planning ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/lung-image-analysis.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lung and Thoracic CT Registration**: Fraunhofer MEVIS has innovated in non-rigid lung registration techniques, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy with rapid runtimes (~25 seconds). This enables effective comparison of thoracic scans over time, which is crucial for disease progression monitoring and therapy assessment ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/fast-and-accurate-lung-image-registration.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cardiac Imaging**: Their software solutions also extend to multimodal cardiac image analysis, providing tools for cardiac structure quantification and early detection of cardiac conditions ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/solutionpages/solutions-for-cardiac-imaging.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Research and Contributions**: Fraunhofer MEVIS actively participates in scientific communities such as MICCAI and contributes to workshops and conferences focusing on thoracic image analysis, sharing insights and technological advancements. They also contributed to interactive visualizations like a 3D virtual journey through the heart, enhancing understanding of cardiac anatomy ([source](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-scicom/institute-news/2020/fraunhofer-mevis-at-virtual-miccai-2020.html), [Press Release](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-scicom/press-release/virtual-journey-through-the-heart--fraunhofer-mevis-creates-a-th.html)).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Collaboration and Integration**: Their solutions are embedded in broader clinical workflows and partner collaborations, such as with Veolity, aiming to integrate automated image analysis into clinical decision-making ([source](https://www.veolity.com/about-veolity/partners)).\n",
